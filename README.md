# Scaffold a full stack app with Remix and Supabase

This is a demo project to show you how to start building full stack apps with [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)

This app is a simple dashboard to manager users, you can list all users, delete them, edit them and finally add them (CRUD).

**Take not that I didn't implemented authentication yet in this example.**
