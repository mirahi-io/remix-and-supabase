# Scaffold a full stack app with Remix and Supabase

This is a demo project to show you how to start building full stack apps with [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)

You will need to provide an `API_URL` and `API_KEY` environnement variable to interact with a Supabase project.

**Take not that I didn't implemented authentication yet in this example.**
